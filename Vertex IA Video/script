Scene 1:INTRODUCTION
	Frame 1+2+3:
		@* ($some intresting story to attract the audience with a supporting visual,
		Example- 
		imagine you're at a party with just 23 people. you start chatting, someone mentions their birthdayâ€”and suddenly, two people in the room realize they share the same one. weird, right? you d think the chances are low but math says otherwise. welcome to the mind-bending world of permutations and combinations, where your intuition doesn't always get it right.$

SCENE 2:DERANGEMENT
	Frame1: Idea
		*(take a small deck of cards named 1-10 and there are 10 spots
		and shuffle the cards and put it in the places 
		{u can just predefine which spot gets which card in order to make it with the narration}
		@{during the animation}- explain that for an example i have 10 cards from 1 to 10 and i ....... as u can see i got 0 matches and well thats quiet unlucky as the probability of getting a match is 63%
		)
	Frame2: Explanation
		@ this probability is calculated by
		/ Probability for derangements = [Number of derangements / Total permutations] x 100 (P(x) = (!n / n!) x 100)
		@ now you must be wondering what is this reverse factorial looking thing, it is called derangement and is usually represented with 
		*!n = n!/e $try make e look like the euler number$
		@ so putting this in the formula we get probability
