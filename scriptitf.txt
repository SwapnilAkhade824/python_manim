	# voice over
	- text

Frame1:
	Intro-
		/ sinx graph --> sin^-1 x (transition)
		- inverse trigo (something catchy intro)

Frame2:
	# intro voiceover with 
	- all the topics which we will learn

Frame3:
	/ left side: full y = sin(x) curve
 	/ horizontal lines intersect multiple times → show it’s not invertible
	/ highlight the domain [-π/2, π/2] with bold curve
	/ right side: flip restricted graph over y = x → plot arcsin(x)
	/ do same for cos(x) (restrict to [0, π]) → arccos(x)
	/ and tan(x) (restrict to (−π/2, π/2)) → arctan(x)
	/ side by side: show domain and range in boxes
	# Explanation 
	- all the text related to sin cos tan and their inverse

Frame4: 
    / for each trig function:
	/ graph original (with restricted domain)
	/ pick point → animate reflecting across y = x
	/ slowly build arcsin, arccos, arctan
	/ final grid view:
	/ top row: sin, cos, tan (restricted)
	/ bottom row: arcsin, arccos, arctan
	/ add smooth colors + range highlighting
	/ show how each inverse is a reflection of the original
    # this is how to visualize the graphing
    - no text

Frame5:
	/ show sin(sin^-1(x)) is not always = x
	/ show how only sin^-1 returns only principal value that is its range

Frame6:
	/ all common values etc ( on circle like polar graph)


Frame7:
