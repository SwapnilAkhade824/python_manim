Frame 1:
	Title slide 
		"Understanding the concept of integration"
	//	"some animation of the integral sign"??

Frame 2:
	Definition of integration
		"It is the reverse of differentiation and often reffered 
		to as anti derivative"
	// 	draw a function f(x) turning into F(x) #small simple function#

Frame 3:
	Show a graph and then use the rectangular method
	show how smaller the rectangles, the accurate is the area

Frame 4:
	start with frame 3 again and this time add the notations 
	(limit del x tends to 0 ) part

Frame 5:
	explain 
		indefinite (gives a general function)
		definite (gives a value)

Frame 6:
	example velocity vs time
		show its easy to calc displacement when its constant velocity 

Frame 7:
	show how to find area of a varying velocity (starts with 0 goes to 5 comes back to 0 type shi)

Frame 8: 
	Put some shit like a quote or smething and end
	//“the integral sign ∫ was introduced by leibniz in 1675. 
	it’s just a stretched-out ‘s’, for summa—the latin word for sum.”
